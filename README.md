# Managing Packages with NPM :symbols:

This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp's Back End Development and APIs studies.


## Functionality :heavy_check_mark:

-  npm (Node Package Manager), is a command line tool to install, create, and share packages of JavaScript code written for Node.js. There are many open source packages available on npm, so before starting a project, take some time to explore so you don't end up recreating the wheel for things like working with dates or fetching data from an API.

- In this course, you'll learn the basics of using npm, including how to work with the package.json and how to manage your installed dependencies.
